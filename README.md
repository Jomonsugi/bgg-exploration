# Board Game Recommendation

### Purpose

1. Build a recommendation system for current users of boardgamegeek.com (the IMBD of board games) by making use
of the the users ratings and comments associated with their ratings 

2. For those who are not active users of boardgamegeek.com, provide a tool that uses an ensemble of methods to 
cluster games, thus providing a reference point for those that have a game or two they like, and are looking 
for a new game to try. Potentially an option for a cold start as well.
